I want to know the dependence of the attendance and unemployment on covid cases and I searched the statistics of 8 counties in Texas.
I plot the attendance and unemployment with covid cases from the summer to winter in 2020, which is the most active infection in that time.
I want to see the relationship with these two independent factors with covid cases and I build models of linear regression with this equation y=ax1+bx2+cx1*x2 (variables: x1 = attendance, x2 = unemployment / y = covid cases)and analyze the linear regressions and interaction plot.
I thought the attendance and covid has a close relationship because covid prevent the attendance.
When comparing the relationship with variables and covid cases, Irving, ElPaso, Montogomery, Tarrant and Harris have correlationship with covid cases and attendance, but others were not so It can't be said that there is relationship with covid cases and attendace. Also, the unemployment got decreased as covid casese are i
ncreasing except the last month. It means despite the pandemic, we can see that people try to find a job.
