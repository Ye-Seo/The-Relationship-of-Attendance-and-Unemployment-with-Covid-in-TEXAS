I want to know the dependence of the attendance and unemployment on covid cases and I searched the statistics in Texas.
I plot the attendance and unemployment with covid cases from the summer to winter in 2020.
I want to see the relationship with these two independent factors with covid cases and I build models of linear regression with this equation y=ax1+bx2+c (variables: x1 = attendance, x2 = employment / y = covid cases)
And I used four counties (FortWorthArlington, Irving, ElPaso and Montogomery) to compare the relationship with variables and covid cases.
